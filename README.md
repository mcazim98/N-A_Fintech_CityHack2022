## Description of the Project
The importance of cryptocurrency and financial securities is increasing exponentially day by day. More money has flown into the stock-based funds in the last five months than the past 12 years combined in the US(CNBC,2021). Similarly, research shows that people who own cryptocurrencies rose by 37.8% this year(Datareportal,2022).

As the investments in securities and crypto-currency rise steadily, the barriers to entry for Gen-Z investors rise with it. Existing websites such as Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal are expensive for entry-level investors, and others such as Yahoo! Finance have incomplete information to make informed decisions. It is also difficult for investors to look for sites with different functionalities for crypto and financial securities and find brokers for investments.

oneStock.com is your one-stop investment solution. It is a platform for investors that incorporates information from various sources and provides all the necessary information that an investor needs to start investing. It is fast, user-friendly, and interactive, making investing more straightforward and accessible.

What makes oneStock.com distinguishable from other sites is that it incorporates sentiment analysis and additional information from public discussion platforms such as Reddit. It also provides an accessible intermediary platform for the investors to connect to reliable and experienced brokers for investment purposes for free.

oneStock.com aims to help entry-level investors to be introduced to the investing world. Our mission is to replace traditional investing sites by offering an exceptional open-source experience and resolutions to existing problems in the market in the long term.
